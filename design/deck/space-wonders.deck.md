## Why Space is Mind-Blowing 🤯

<div class="fragment fade-up">

**Space is completely silent**

*Because there's no atmosphere to carry sound waves*

**One day on Venus is longer than its year**

*243 Earth days to rotate vs 225 to orbit the Sun*

**Neutron stars spin 600 times per second**

- **Jupiter** = a grape (135 yards away)
- **Neptune** = a pea (half a mile away!)

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">

**Mind-bender:**

*The nearest star would be another basketball...*
