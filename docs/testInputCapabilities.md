# Test Input Capabilities

## A Poem for the Tester

In lines of code where bugs may hide,  
We write our tests with patient pride.  
Each edge case caught, each path we trace,  
Brings confidence to our codebase.

The red turns green, the suite runs clean,  
A testament to what we've seen.  
For every fail, a lesson learned,  
Until the green light has been earned.

So here's to tests, both old and new,  
The safety net that sees us through.  
May coverage high and flakiness low,  
Guide every commit that we bestow.

*Write tests as if your future self will thank you.*
